# React Component Generator for Yeoman

Unless your project is configured like mine, this probably won't do much for you. However, this may make a good starting point for your own Yeoman generator.

## Getting Started

First, install the generator: `npm install -g generator-rcomp`

Then `cd` to the desired directory and run `yo rcomp MyComponent`, where `MyComponent` is the name of your component.
